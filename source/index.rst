The purpose of Tosca is to facilitate writing compilers and other syntax-directed transformation systems,
by providing:

* a programming language with

  * special notations for using embedded syntax, even higher order abstract syntax
  * special support for symbol tables, environments, and attributes, as used in compilers
  * a polymorphic type system

* a compiler generating high-level, readable Java 8 or C++ code, for effective execution
* a meta parser generator enabling concrete syntax pattern matching and correct instantiation
