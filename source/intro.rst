Introduction************CRS stands for Combinatory Reduction Systems, which is a powerful rewriting formalism invented by P. Aczel and J. W. Klop.The idea of CRS is to allow rewrite rules that support matching of variable binding constructs and substitution aspart of rewrite steps, collectively known as higher-order rewriting.Tosca implements CRS with a number of extension borrowed from functional programming and semantics,to facilitate using CRS for writing compilers and similar “real world” transformation systems.
